==Rules
===Heavy Barrage
Does the Night modifier on Fire Rating affect the ability for an indirect fire attack to generate Heavy Barrage? 
Barrage status is determined by the fire rating plus modifiers due to markers, and company bonus (if attained). Weather/time (night) has no impact. [CSW, Nick Richardson, http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@@.1dda6eb2/5217 ]

===Assault
====Bravery calculation
 . The terrain used as modifier for the bravery check is the terrain of the defending unit used to determine the bravery check. [CSW, Tom Holliday reports on discussion he had on this point with Nick Richardson, http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dda6eb2/6087 ]
 . For the bravery check you take the (modified) defense strength of *either* the defending hex *or* a hex that exerts a FZ on the Assaulting units, which ever is best. [CSW, Nick Richardson, http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@@.1dda6eb2/5328 ]

The steps to follow are: 
. Identify all eligible defender units (those in the assaulted hex plus all those that have a FZ on the assaulting unit's hex.
. For each calculate the (modified) defense strength (this includes terrain modifier,  IP, ENT, Column, bocage, para/glider delay)
. Add the lowest resulting (modified) defense strength to the Bravery value of the assaulting units

===Organic Transport
Examples of movements that cause loss of Organic Transport:
Note that the capitalized word Road stands for all types of road, railroad, causeway, sunken road, elevated road.

. Crossing a stream hexside (except when in column mode and there is a Raod crossing that hexside). Note that Road Blocks on either side of the stream hexside cancels the effect of the Road).
. Entering a wood hex through an hexside that does not contain a Road. Note that Road Blocks on either side (?? or only on the entered hex??) of the hexside cancels the effect of the Road).
  Note that as the rule stands, moving from a wood hex to a clear hex though a hexside that does not contain a Road does not cause Abandoned Transport.

===Divisional Trucks / Jeeps
Can divisional truck that was dismounted from a unit in a chit activation be reused in the same chit activation phase by another active unit?

===Phone Lines
Rule 16.1 German phone lines says that the phone lines are cut when any naval unit rolls a 0 when bombarding any hex on the overlay. does this include the LCRs and LCSs? Yes [CSW, Adam Starkweather, http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@@.1dda6eb2/1369 ]

===Allied Air Power
When a German 88 is put into an artillery park it retains its AA ability. [CSW, Adam Starkweather, http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@@.1dda6eb2/1369 ]

===Naval procedure
Leaders that are in Landing Crafts do not provide command to any units. [CSW, Adam Starkweather, http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@@.1dda6eb2/1369 ]

===Bocage
Q: Can a Nachhut with no movement allowance enter bocage?
A: Yes, rule does not restrict any German units from entering bocage, as long as they can perform an Engineer Action.
Ref: CSW,2566 Adam http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@@.1dda6eb2/2633 Nachhuthen with or without movement points can enter Bocage

===Opportunity Fire
Q: When a stack moves, is opportunity fire triggered against each unit or only once against the whole stack. A:Only one unit. Ref: 14.7 Paraagraph 2 "If a moving stack triggers Opportunity Fire (see Rule 17.0), any Unit firing gets to target only one of the stacked Units, 
but the Non-Active Player does get to choose which one."

===Miscenalleous
====Wittman
Can be placed only when one of the s.SS-Pz.101 units has become active. This can occure when the approprieate Divisional Activation chit is pulled or during a Formation Activation if the unit is activated by the Leader. The placement of Wittman gives 4 FREE actions that replace (are not in addition to) the standard activation. (This is mentionned in the side note about Wittmann in page 42 near 16.2)
